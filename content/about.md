Hi. My name is Rewdy (Andrew).

When I was 5, my dad brought home a [Macintosh SE30](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_SE). Somehow, I figured out how to set up [HyperCard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypercard) "Stacks" and I started writing simple little scripts that would do things like play a series of notes or make a little guy walk across the screen.

I've always loved the magic that happens when you write some code and then watch something happen. It thrills me. Because of this, when my family got the Internet and I discovered you could create your own sites, I had to make one.

Since I was about 14, I've been using the Internet to make stuff. I studied Graphic Design in school and started to work professionally building websites in 2005.

I work for a company in Des Moines, Iowa making websites.
