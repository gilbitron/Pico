I recently discovered Pico. The Pico website describes it as, "A stupidly simple & blazing fast, flat file CMS." It's basically some glue to combine Markdown (for content) and Twig (for templating). It's quite nice and, I believe, lives up to it's tagline.

I played around with it this weekend and identified a few areas for improvement. One of them is pagination, which to my knowledge, it does not yet support. Using Pico's plugin architecture, I threw together simple pagination plugin, tested it a bit, and am releasing it now.

Try it out and let me know your thoughts. I'm sure there are bugs in it or room for improvement.
