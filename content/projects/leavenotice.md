**LeaveNotice** is a plug in to easily notify your users that they are leaving your website. This was developed with “official” type websites in mind (Government, money-processing, etc). Because of the nature of the information those sites house, it can be important to make sure users know that they are being linked to a site not under “official” jurisdiction.
